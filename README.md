# Password Generator

Here is the password generator script that includes a CLI with a help message and usage examples

To display the help message and usage examples for the script, you can run it with the -h or --help argument:

`python paladin.py -h`

To use this script, you can run it from the command line with the -l argument followed by the desired password length and additional arguments to customize the password. For example:

`python paladin.py -l 16 -u -lc -n -s`

This will generate a 16-character password that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. If you do not specify the -l argument, the script will use the default password length of 8 characters.
